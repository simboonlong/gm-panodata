This is something that I cook up to copy paste latlng data easily from panorama streetview. Hope it helps.

## What's wrong with current way of getting latlng data from googlemaps?
It's easy to get latlng data from the google map, but it's a little troublesome if you want to copy paste the latlng data based on a google streetview location you like.

There are generally 2 ways I know of:

Method 1 (on google map)
- right click > what's here? > copy paste latlng data.
- many steps, troublesome, cannot get the correct streetview location too.

Method 2 (from url)
- copy paste data from url params directly.
- a much better option compared to method 1.

## Demo

## Usage
1. drop pegman on map.
2. drag panorama to get latlng + heading, pitch.
